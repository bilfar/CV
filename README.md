## Nabil Far 

I am an enthusiastic and highly motivated full stack Junior Developer. 
After graduating from University with a degree in Applied Sciences, I spent eight years working for different pharmaceutical companies as a Laboratory Analyst. Because of my background I developed a strong analytical and logic thinking skill that I enjoyed during coding. I hope to work with others who are passionate about clean code, TDD and pair programming.

## Skills

Skills I've developed through my previous work:

Analytical
In my role as analyst, I analysed data on a daily basis to check the correctness. For a research project I had to study scientific literature to find the genetic-code that I was looking for. In the following years I developed a keen eye for fine details.

Problem solving 
I am not afraid of challenges. Love finding a good solution for any issues. My final team-mates credited my positive influence as being a crucial aspect to our project success. All problems become smaller when you confront them instead of dodging them.

Team driving 
I am energetic and ambitious and love to share this with my team. Always comfortable finding my place in a team. I see new challenges as opportunities to do something awesome. Team mates credited me for my openminded, easy going and professional personality.
