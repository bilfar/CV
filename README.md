I am an enthusiastic and highly motivated full stack Junior Developer.I am a developer who trained at Makers Academy, a highly selective immersive program to learn to code, where I have had the time of my life learning something I love.

After graduating from University with a degree in Applied Sciences, I spent eight years working for different pharmaceutical companies as a Laboratory Analyst. Because of my background I developed a strong analytical and logic thinking skill that I enjoyed during coding. I hope to work with others who are passionate about clean code, TDD and pair programming.

## Skills

#### Clean code
Makers shaped and facilitated my want to be a purveyor of clean code. Always aiming to sharpen my toolset & craft well-written, readable code

#### Problem solving
I am not afraid of challenges. Love finding a good solution for any issues. My final team-mates credited my positive influence as being a crucial aspect to our project success. All problems become smaller when you confront them instead of dodging them.

#### Team driving 
I am energetic and ambitious and love to share this with my team. Always comfortable finding my place in a team. I see new challenges as opportunities to do something awesome. Team mates credited me for my openminded, easy going and professional personality.
