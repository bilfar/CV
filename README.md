I am an enthusiastic and highly motivated full stack Junior Developer.I am a developer who trained at Makers Academy, a highly selective immersive program to learn to code, where I have had the time of my life learning something I love. I would like to work at a company that encourages me to continue learning and keep pushing myself to become a better developer. 

After graduating from University with a degree in Applied Sciences, I spent eight years working for different pharmaceutical companies as a Laboratory Analyst. Because of my background I developed a strong analytical and logic thinking skill that I enjoyed during coding.

## Skills

#### Clean code
Makers shaped and facilitated my want to be a purveyor of clean, well-tested code. I use TDD to decrease the likelihood of introducing bugs, make my code easier to refactor, and provide confidence and focus to my development process. I make sure that my code is DRY and stick to good design principles, so as to write code that others can understand and that is easy to change. 
 
#### Problem solving
I am not afraid of challenges. Love finding a good solution for any issues. I take a proactive approach to learning relevant new technologies for each project by reading the documentation and am taking special attention when it comes to learn or develop new knowledge and skills. My final team-mates credited my positive influence as being a crucial aspect to our project success. All problems become smaller when you confront them instead of dodging them.

#### Team driving 
I am energetic and ambitious and love to share this with my team. Always comfortable finding my place in a team. I see new challenges as opportunities to do something awesome. Team mates credited me for my openminded, easy going and professional personality, deliver and receive feedback. I strive to apply XP values when collaborating on code with another person.

## Interests
Besides my big passion: coding,  I’m also having two other loves in my life. The first love is videography. I love filming and editing videos as documentaries, portraits of just short movies. I hear you saying what about? well, it can be everything as friends, nature, city or something else. My second love, I called futuristic-digital, even if it sounds digital I love it. Here are a few examples: sci-fi series or movies (one of my favourite serie is the original Night Rider), but I have also very strong interests in artificial-intelligence, Virtual-Reality, gadget, tech-news, electro music and trance music. My favourite DJ's are the two Dutch DJ’s Tiesto and Armin van Buuren.
